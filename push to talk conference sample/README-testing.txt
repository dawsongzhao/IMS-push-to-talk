A b2bua-archetype project includes support for manually deploying a test app,
or for automatically starting a container, deploying the app, and running 
test cases.

KitCAT test cases go in src/test/java. Test harness code, if necessary, 
goes in src/testharness/java. See README-project-structure.txt for more 
information about the project directory strucuture.

src/test/resources includes several files used to configure the test cases:

- approuter.xml is used to configure the DFC application router. Initially
  this is only supported on Sailfin.

- mobicents-dar.properties is used to configure the Mobicents default router.

- log4j.properties is used to configure KitCAT's logging output

- test.properies is used to configure IP addresses and ports used by the
  KitCAT test cases. These values can also be specified on the command line,
  e.g., 'mvn -DSipAS=localhost:5080 verify'.

If automated deployment is used, and if the E4SS app has simple routing 
requirements, no changes should be required in any of these files.

Manual Deployment
-----------------

To manually deploy and test an app, run

    mvn package

to build sar files in target. Deploy the Test sar file to a 
container and perform any required container and application router 
configuration. Edit src/test/resources/test.properties to
point to the correct host and ports. You can also specify these settings
with system properties in the next step. 

Run the tests with

    mvn verify

To specify host and port (without modifying test.resources), run

    mvn -DSipAS=<host>:<port> verify

Automated Deployment
--------------------

See documentation at:

    http://echarts.sourceforge.net/docs/sar-deploy-maven-plugin/

for more information about configuring Mobicents, Sailfin, or WebSphere to
support automated deployment of test sars generated by this project.
